Imagine a world where humanity has finally reached the stars and we're not just talking | start: 0.0 | end: 5.24
about any old spacecraft, but the most advanced cutting edge, and sustainable spaceships that | start: 5.24 | end: 11.4
are changing the game. | start: 11.4 | end: 13.32
These are not just mere vessels, but a new era of human travel that's about to revolutionize | start: 13.32 | end: 18.72
the way we explore and experience the cosmos. | start: 18.72 | end: 22.48
Did you know that NASA's Artemis program is already making waves in the space industry? | start: 22.48 | end: 27.68
They are not just building a new lunar base. | start: 27.68 | end: 30.16
They are creating a new frontier for human exploration. | start: 30.16 | end: 33.68
With their state of the art spacecraft, | start: 33.68 | end: 36.08
the Orion and the space launch system, | start: 36.08 | end: 38.8
they are pushing the boundaries of what's possible. | start: 38.8 | end: 41.8
But it's not just about the technology, | start: 41.8 | end: 44.24
it's about the people. | start: 44.24 | end: 45.6
The astronauts who are training for these missions are not just astronauts, | start: 45.6 | end: 50.24
they are the future of humanity. They are the ones who will be the first to set foot | start: 50.24 | end: 55.28
on Mars to explore the rings of Saturn and to discover the secrets of the universe. | start: 55.28 | end: 60.8
And it's not just about the destinations, it's about the journey. The experience | start: 60.8 | end: 66.16
of being in space is not just about the destination, it's about the journey itself. The thrill | start: 66.16 | end: 72.2
of weightlessness, the awe of witnessing the earth from space, and the sense of wonder that | start: 72.2 | end: 76.9
comes from exploring the unknown. So what does the future of human travel look like? It's | start: 76.9 | end: 83.04
not just about reaching the stars, it's | start: 83.04 | end: 85.48
about becoming one with the universe. It's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible | start: 85.48 | end: 91.12
and exploring the unknown. It's about becoming a part of something bigger than ourselves | start: 91.12 | end: 96.52
and discovering the secrets of the cosmos. Spaceships are the future of human travel and | start: 96.52 | end: 102.68
it's time to get excited about it. Let's join the journey and see where it takes us | start: 102.68 | end: 108.36
